are chicken tikka:
Chicken tikka is a chicken dish originating in the Indian subcontinent;
 the dish is popular in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
 It is traditionally small pieces of boneless chicken baked using skewers on a brazier called angeethi after 
 marinating in Indian spices and dahi (yogurt)—essentially a boneless version of tandoori chicken. Thed tikka
  (Tike in Turkish, and Tikə in Azerbaijani) is a Persian word, meaning "bits" or "pieces". 
It is also a chicken dish served in Punjabi cuisine. 
The Kashmiri version of the dish, 
however, is grilled over red-hot coals,
and does not always contain boneless pieces. 
The pieces are brushed with ghee (clarified butter) at intervals to increase its flavour, 
while being continuously fanned. 
It is typically eaten with green coriander and tamarind chutney served with onion rings and lemon,
or used in preparing a chicken tikka masala.

A chicken tikka sizzler is a dish where chicken tikka is served on a heated plate with onions. The dish is 
also popular in Afghanistan, though the Afghan variant (like many other Persian, Turkish, and Arab dishes) is
 less spicy compared to the variants in the Indian subcontinent and uses beef and lamb in addition to chicken.

2)Palak paneer
Palak paneer is a vegetarian dish originating from the Indian subcontinent,
 consisting of paneer (a type of cottage cheese) in a thick paste made from puréed spinach, 
 called palak in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and other Indian languages.

The terms palak paneer and saag paneer are sometimes used interchangeably in restaurants in the United States 
and Canada. However, saag paneer is different from traditional palak paneer in that it contains other green 
leafy vegetables, such as mustard greens, whereas palak paneer only contains spinach.Dhaba restaurants often 
specialize in palak paneer.

Preparation:
Palak paneer is prepared by first boiling and pureeing spinach.
The puree is then mixed with sauted tomatoes and onions.
Grilled cubes of paneer are then added to the puree. 
Palak paneer is typically spiced with ginger, garlic, tomatoes, garam masala, turmeric, chili powder and
cumin.
